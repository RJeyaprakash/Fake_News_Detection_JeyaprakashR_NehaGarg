# Fake_News_Detection_JeyaprakashR_NehaGarg
This project aims to detect fake news using semantic classification. By leveraging Word2Vec embeddings, it captures the meaning of words in news articles and uses supervised learning models to classify them as real or fake. The focus is on understanding context rather than relying on just keywords.
